 ## Technologies Used:
 
1.**ASP.NET Core MVC:** The project is built on the ASP.NET Core MVC framework, which provides a powerful architecture for building web applications.

2.**Entity Framework Core SQLServer:** Entity Framework Core is used as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework to interact with the SQL Server database. It simplifies data access and manipulation by allowing developers to work with database entities as .NET objects.

3.**AutoMapper:** AutoMapper is employed for object-to-object mapping, enabling seamless conversion between different data models within the application.

4.**Bogus:** Bogus is utilized for generating fake data, facilitating the population of the database with random data for testing purposes.

5.**Entity Framework Core Design:** Entity Framework Core Design package is used for design-time Entity Framework Core commands, allowing for database migrations and scaffolding.

6.**Entity Framework Core Tools:** Entity Framework Core Tools provide additional command-line tools for Entity Framework Core operations, enhancing development efficiency.

7.**Entity Framework Core DependencyInjection:** This package enables Entity Framework Core to be easily integrated with the ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection framework.
